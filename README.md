### 🔥 What Makes Me Different

Most ML engineers come from data science backgrounds and struggle with production systems.  
I come from production systems and am learning ML.

I don't just train models. I deploy them, monitor them, scale them, and maintain them.

**Currently available for ML Engineer / MLOps Engineer opportunities starting Q2 2025.**
